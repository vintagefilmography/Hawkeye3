This is the documentation for Hawkeye3 simple Wolverine mod that replaces the stock camera 
with an equvalent camera that does not have digital artifacts issue.
The Wolverine controller and its camera are moved to the back of the unit allowing enough free space for the new camera.
The camera used is the usb ELP model ELP-USBFHD04H-FV. It uses an AR0330 sensor with 1080P resolution. Essentially, the same
sensor that the Wolverine model uses but unlike Wolverine this one allows the user full access to the camera settings. 
The camera connects to a Windows PC that runs a capture software (included here). The capture software anywhere between 
10 and 30 FPS and dcreates a video that includes the film transitions. The transitions can subsequently be removed with the 
postprocessing software (also included).
